## Class Description

Welcome to CSE 110A: Fundamentals of Compiler Design! In this class we 
will explore one of the most important tools in computer science: the 
compiler. In particular, we will explore how compiler techniques transform 
high level languages into low-level languages, i.e. closer to the 
instructions that processors can actually execute. We will study how 
compilers can automatically make code more efficient and safe to execute. 
When you leave this class you should be comfortable with: specifying 
programming language grammars, how to efficiently parse these languages, 
and how to convert complex high-level code into equivalent (and hopefully 
more performant) low-level code. 

Given the influx in domain-specific languages, and the explosion of 
architectural diversity occuring in computing today, these are very
valuable skills.

## Teaching Staff

The university hires additional teaching staff to help you with your studies.
All of them have lots of experience in compilers. 

Please get to know them and take advantage of the office hours and 
mentoring sessions they provide.

- *Grad TA*: Zheyuan Chen <zchen406@ucsc.edu>
- *Undergrad Mentors/Graders*: (TBD 4 staff members)

## Class Modules

This class will be split into 4 modules, each of which are roughly two weeks:

* **Module 1: Lexing** 

* **Module 2: Parsing** 

* **Module 3: Intermediate Representations** 

* **Module 4: Optimizations**  


## Office Hours:

### Instructor Office Hours:

I will provide 1 to 2 office hours per week. It will most likely be online. 
More details will be announced.  

Here is a link to: [**Office Hours & Tutoring CSE110A Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y18wYjQ0NTllZTJjNTYxMjc5ZTU2NjRiYzY3ZTYxOWNmYWIxZWQ4OGIxOTNlNzE0NzNlNTQ2MGNhMzc0ZTYyYTI4Q@group.calendar.google.com)

## Homework:

Your final submission will be through the gradescope link using canvas.
This is to help provide fair (and scalable) grading across the increasing 
diversity of devices that everyone has these days. 

Homeworks are due at midnight on their due date, but do not plan on 
help after 5 pm.

This class has homeworks that build on each other, that is, later 
homeworks will use earlier homeworks. We will provide some reference 
solutions so that your later homeworks are not impacted by mistakes 
in earlier homeworks. Because of this, we cannot accept late homeworks 
and we will be strict about this. Please keep this in mind. It is a 
good idea to plan to have homeworks done in advance, or upload 
checkpoints.

## Quizzes

Periodic quizzes will be assigned and you will have a due date do get them done.  These are meant to test your understanding, and will not be graded for correctness, but instead, graded for engagement. Any multiple choice question will be awarded full points: any open response question will be graded on if there was some sign of engagement (e.g., a few thoughtful sentences written). These quizzes will account for 10% of your class grade.

You can miss up to 2 quizzes without penalty.

The combination of attendance and quiz participation will 
account for 10% of your grade.

## Tests:

There will be two tests in this course: a midterm and a final. The midterm will 
roughly be worth as much as a single homework assignment (~10%). The final 
will be worth 30%.

The midterm will be given halfway through the class. The date is yet to 
be determined.

Please look at canvas announcment for further details.

The final will be given at a time yet to be determined by the University
during final's week which is between 3/16-3/20 of 2026.

## Grade Breakdown

- Attendance/Quiz: 10%
- Homeworks: 50% (4 to 5 of them)
- Midterm: 10%
- Final Exam: 30%

If you want to discuss a grade, please contact the teaching staff no 
later than 1 week after the grades are posted.
